Extended Kalman filter Implementation for state of charge (SoC) estimation

# Python implementation
The "Python" folder contain a python3 implementation of an extended Kalman filter for state of charge (SoC) estimation of a simulated lithium battery. 
A Basic Thevenin model is used to model the battery. 

A CC/CV charge and a pulse discharge will be simulated. Then a graph will be displayed showing simulation results. 
You can play around with the capacity and Thevenin model values in Python/main.py. The charge/discharge protocol can also be changed, values are found in Python/protocol.py.
